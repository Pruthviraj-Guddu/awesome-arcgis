## Introduction

> Note: Personal GeoDatabases were introduced by Esri in ArcGIS for Desktop 8.0 (1999).

**Description**: Original data format for ArcGIS geodatabases stored and managed in Microsoft Access data files.(This is limited in size and tied to the Windows operating system.)

**Number of users**: Single user and small workgroups with smaller datasets: some readers and one writer. Concurrent use eventually degrades for large numbers of readers.

**Storage format**: All the contents in each personal geodatabase are held in a single Microsoft Access file (.mdb).

**Size limits**: Two GB per Access database. The effective limit before performance degrades is typically between 250 and 500 MB per Access database file.

**Versioning support**: Only supported as a geodatabase for clients who post updates using checkout and check-in and as a client to which updates can be sent using one-way replication.

**Platforms**: Windows only.

**Security and permissions**: Windows file system security.

**Database administration tools**: Windows file system management.

**Notes**: Often used as an attribute table manager (via Microsoft Access). Users like the string handling for text attributes.
