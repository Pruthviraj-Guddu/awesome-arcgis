## Introduction

Lidar (light detection and ranging) is an optical remote-sensing technique that uses laser light to densely sample the surface of the earth, producing highly accurate x,y,z measurements.

## People you should know

Please find the ArcGIS Experts on this topic here: [https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=Lidar](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=Lidar)

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
