## Introduction

> **GIS and [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design)**
> At their core, CAD and GIS are complementary technologies that have evolved largely independently over the past 30 years. Esri's longtime best-of-breed approach provides value to customers by building better linkages between CAD and GIS systems. - Learn more about [GIS and CAD](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/gis-cad)

Currently, [AutoCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD) and [MicroStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroStation) are the two most widely used general-purpose CAD platforms.

## Data storage

* **Database formats**: ...
* **File formats**: [DWG](../../../data-storage/file-formats/dwg/README.md), [DXF](../../../data-storage/file-formats/dxf/README.md) and [DGN](../../../data-storage/file-formats/dwg/README.md) are the file formats for CAD data supported by ArcGIS. Computer-Aided Design aids in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a 2D and 3D designs

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
