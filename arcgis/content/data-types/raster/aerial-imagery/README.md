# Aerial photography (or airborne imagery)

Aerial photography (or airborne imagery) is the taking of photographs from an aircraft or other flying object. Platforms for aerial photography include fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or "drones"), balloons, blimps and dirigibles, rockets, pigeons, kites, parachutes, stand-alone telescoping and vehicle-mounted poles | *Source:  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_photography)*.

## Introduction

This type of imagery is usually used when we need more accurate/detailed data than [satellite sensors data](../satellite-sensor/README.md).

Resolution/accuracy can vary based on many factors as: sensor, height of the flight, weather, ...
