## Introduction

[ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET Official Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/)

ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET contains APIs (for [WPF](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/guide/display-a-map.htm), [UWP](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/uwp/guide/display-a-map.htm), ...) that enable you to build native mapping apps and share source code across Windows, Android, and iOS. Integrate a range of mapping and GIS capabilities online or offline, including 2D and 3D data visualization, web and mobile maps, editing, geocoding, routing, and spatial analysis.

If you are considering to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of [our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123](../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders).

## Training

### Documentation

Important concepts:

* Mobile map package - [Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/android/guide/display-a-map.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_4CCB74E11EE04611849F3C0F41D9381C), [iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/ios/guide/display-a-map.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_4CCB74E11EE04611849F3C0F41D9381C) & [Forms](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/forms/guide/display-a-map.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_4CCB74E11EE04611849F3C0F41D9381C): is a file object (.mmpk) created in ArcGIS Pro. It is a transport mechanism for maps, their layers, data, networks, and locators. A mobile map package can be sideloaded onto a device by email, or by platform-specific transfer mechanism, or it can be downloaded from a portal to the device. It available for applications developed using ArcGIS Runtime SDK starting with version 100.0.
