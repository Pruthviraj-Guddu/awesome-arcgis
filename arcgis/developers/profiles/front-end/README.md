## Introduction to ArcGIS API
[ArcGIS Javascript API](technologies/dojo/README.md) is built in top of [Dojo Toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org/) because it was the first technology allowing to load dependencies in an asynchronous way (using [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition)) as many other modern libraries are doing today ([JSConfUS 2013: Dojo already did that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY0-AI1Sxy0)).

## Getting started
If you are one of those who do not like reading and prefer to learn by looking at code, visit: [esri-es.github.io/arcgis-web-samples](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-web-samples/).

### Compatible technologies
If you are still reading ... go to "**[Technologies](technologies/README.md)**" to learn how to combine ArcGIS JS API with almost any other framework/library. Do not forget to read the [best practices](best-practices/README.md) in order to get the most of ArcGIS.

### Pricing
There is no technical restrictions that avoid you to start building web applications without signing up, but in order to be able to take the advantage of using [custom vector maps](../arcgis/content/data-storage/service-types/map-service/tile-map-service/vector-tiles/README.md), [store geolocated data](../arcgis/content/data-storage/service-types/feature-service/README.md), use [webmaps](../esri/open-vision/open-specifications/web-map/README.md), use the [smart-mapping](../arcgis/capabilities/smart-mapping/README.md) tools, use some [Location-based services](../arcgis/products/arcgis-online/rest-apis/location-based-services/README.md), etc we recommend you to [**sign up for a free account**](https://developers.arcgis.com/sign-up/).

Learn more about pricing at: [ArcGIS > Developer Plan > Background > Web](../arcgis/developer-plan/background/web/README.md).


## Web mapping history
Did you know how web mapping evolved during the last twenty years? And when each company or technology was launched?, this this diagram:
