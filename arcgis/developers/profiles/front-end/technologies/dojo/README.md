# Dojo

[ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://js.arcgis.com) uses internally
[Dojo Toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org/) to implement more than 300 classes that
allow you to build powerful maps, spatial analysis, data visualizations, etc.

## Introduction

At this point in time there are two generations of the ArcGIS API been maintained:

* [3.x generation](3.x/README.md): for 2D maps
* [4.x generation](4.x/README.md): integrates 2D and 3D

If you are familiar with the ArcGIS API you can check this
[functionality matrix](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/choose-version/index.html),
if you are not and need some hep to decide, then go to the [JavaScript API group at GeoNet](https://community.esri.com/community/developers/web-developers/arcgis-api-for-javascript).

## People you should know

Please find the ArcGIS Experts (story tellers and developers) on this topic here: [https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=Dojo](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=Dojo)

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
