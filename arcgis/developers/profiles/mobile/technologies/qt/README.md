## Introduction

The [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/) is the technology you may want to use if you want to build your Android and iOS applications in C++ & QML.

You also have an IDE to use Qt and QML with several templates, it is called
[App Studio for ArcGIS](../../../desktop/technologies/qt/appstudio/README.md).

You can also use the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](../xamarin/README.md) to build cross mobile applications (Android & iOS) using .NET.

As last resource, you may even consider to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of [our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123](../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders).

And remember, before reinventing the wheel [check the existing Esri mobile apps](../../../arcgis/mobile-apps/README.md) and consider if it make sense for you to integrate with any of the existings before doing an strong investment.

## Training

### Documentation

* [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt Official Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/)
    * Guides: [QML](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/qml/guide/arcgis-runtime-sdk-for-qt.htm) & [C++](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/cpp/guide/arcgis-runtime-sdk-for-qt.htm)
    * API Reference: [C++ API Reference](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/cpp/api-reference/), [QML API Reference](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/qml/api-reference/), [Toolkit](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/toolkit/api-reference/) & [QML Extras](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/extras/api-reference/)

Important concepts:

* Mobile map package - [QML](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/qml/guide/display-a-map.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_4CCB74E11EE04611849F3C0F41D9381C) & [C++](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/cpp/guide/display-a-map.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_4CCB74E11EE04611849F3C0F41D9381C): is a file object (.mmpk) created in ArcGIS Pro. It is a transport mechanism for maps, their layers, data, networks, and locators. A mobile map package can be sideloaded onto a device by email, or by platform-specific transfer mechanism, or it can be downloaded from a portal to the device. It available for applications developed using ArcGIS Runtime SDK starting with version 100.0.
