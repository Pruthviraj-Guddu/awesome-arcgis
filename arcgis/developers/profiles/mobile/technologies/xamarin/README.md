# Xamarin developers

If you are willing to write mobile applications using .NET you are in the right place, the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET contains APIs Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Forms that enable you to build mobile native mapping apps.

## Introduction

It integrates a range of mapping and GIS capabilities online or offline, including 2D and 3D data visualization, web and mobile maps, editing, geocoding, routing, and spatial analysis. Use this site to access installation details, documentation, and sample code.

The [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/) is the technology you may want to use if you want to build your Android and iOS applications in .NET.

You can also use the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt](../qt/README.md) to build cross mobile applications (Android & iOS) using C++ & QML.

As last resource, you may even consider to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of [our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123](../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders).

And remember, before reinventing the wheel [check the existing Esri mobile apps](../../../arcgis/mobile-apps/README.md) and consider if it make sense for you to integrate with any of the existings before doing an strong investment.

## Training

### Documentation

* [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET Official Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/)
* [Official training](www.esri.com/training/Bookmark/PKEDPSDGS)

ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET provides a common API surface across all supported. This allows you to reuse code and to leverage design patterns such as Model View ViewModel (MVVM). Xamarin Forms provides an excellent framework for cross-platform code sharing, and each API reference includes classes specific to Xamarin Forms. There are some differences between APIs, primarily the inheritance hierarchy for objects built for different platforms.

It is a transport mechanism for maps, their layers, data, networks, and locators. A mobile map package can be sideloaded onto a device by email, or by platform-specific transfer mechanism, or it can be downloaded from a portal to the device. It available for applications developed using ArcGIS Runtime SDK starting with version 100.0.
