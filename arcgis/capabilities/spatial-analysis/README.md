## Cool demos & Storymaps

Using spatial analysis you can use spatial information to improve the answer to complex questions like:

* [Where should I open my next store and how much I'm going to earn?](http://envisioning.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=59800d93fd194d2084c1555d1f6492b1)
