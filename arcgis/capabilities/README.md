## Spatial Analytics

Spatial analytics is the heart and soul of ArcGIS. You use it to find the best location for your business, plan for smarter communities, and prepare and respond faster in crucial situations.

Learn more: [Spatial Analytics](./spatial-analysis/README.md)

## Field operations

Location is at the heart of field activities. Focused ArcGIS applications can be used stand-alone or in combination to support field workflows and enable office and field personnel to work in unison, using the same authoritative data.

## Mapping & Visualization

Maps help you spot spatial patterns in your data so you can make better decisions and take action. Maps also break down barriers and facilitate collaboration. ArcGIS gives you the ability to create, use, and share maps on any device.

## Real-Time Visualization and Analytics

Real-time GIS empowers you with location monitoring of any type of sensor or device — accelerating response times, optimizing safety, and improving operational awareness across all assets and activities, whether in motion or at rest.

## 3D GIS

3D GIS brings real-world context to your maps and data. Instantly transform your data into smart 3D models and visualizations that help you analyze and solve problems and share ideas and concepts with your team and customer.

## Imagery & Remote Sensing

ArcGIS gives you everything you need to manage and extract answers from imagery and remotely sensed data. It includes imagery tools and workflows for visualization and analysis, and access to the world’s largest imagery collection.

## Data Collection & Management

With ArcGIS, you can easily collect, crowdsource, store, access, and share your data efficiently and securely. You can integrate data stored in your business systems and geo-enable any data from any source.

Learn more: [Data Collection & Management](../../esri/business-trends/data-management/README.md)

## Offline mapping

ArcGIS provides and let you build native applications that can download maps for use when your device goes offline. Match your business needs to one of the offline workflows to maximize your productivity.
