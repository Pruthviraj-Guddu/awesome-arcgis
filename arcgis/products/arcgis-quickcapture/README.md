# ArcGIS QuickCapture

ArcGIS QuickCapture is the fastest way to collect field observations. With this app, you can quickly record field observations from a moving vehicle while you scout locations, conduct aerial surveys, or assess damage. Send data back to the office for analysis in real time and eliminate time spent manually processing handwritten notes
