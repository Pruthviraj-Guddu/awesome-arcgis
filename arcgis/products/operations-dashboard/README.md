## Introduction

Take a look to the [Official landing page](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/operations-dashboard/overview).

Operations Dashboard used to be a desktop tool that could be extended using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript though an operation view, but now it is not, but you still have [Web AppBuilder Developer Edition](../web-appbuilder/developer-edition/README.md) + [Dashboard Theme](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/create-apps/themes-tab.htm) if you need to do that.

## Getting started

[ArcGIS Solutions Gallery](https://solutions.arcgis.com/gallery/#s=0&md=products-or-applications:Operations%20Dashboard%20for%20ArcGIS) offer a bunch of options for ready-to-use maps, surveys, preconfigured applications, maps and feature layers... where you can filter by industry, products/applications and implementation patterns to jumpstart your work.
