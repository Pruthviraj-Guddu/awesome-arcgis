# Web AppBuilder

[Web AppBuilder](http://www.esri.com/software/web-appbuilder) is a WYSIWYG tool that allow any user to build 2D and 3D map-centric apps (*with a full screen map*) without writing any code. You as a web developer can add new widgets and themes or customize the existing ones.

## Introduction

Web AppBuilder has two versions:

* ArcGIS Online and Portal for ArcGIS hosted version (for non-developers): A WYSIWYG tool that allow them to build and export responsive web apps adding and configuring pre-defined widgets and themes.

* [Developer Edition](developer-edition/README.md) (for developers): It is a self-hosted version but also a framework that can be extended adding custom themes and widgets.

> **Note**: In this page we will focus on the hosted version.
