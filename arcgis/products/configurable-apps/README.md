## Introduction

So far Esri has released more than 40 [open source templates](#apps-developed-by-esri)
with different purposes: collect/edit data, compare maps/layers,
explore/summarize data, get directions, map social media, provide local
information, showcase 2D or 3D maps, etc.

The best thing is that **you as a developer can write your own templates** ([learn how](#training)).

Check the configurable apps Esri has been releasing during the last years:


[![Esri configurable apps evolution](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/13qEcQp7Mh2wQwJmV2EMhj3__qwf7CI26MnEbGHnejSU/pub?w=1770&h=1318)](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/13qEcQp7Mh2wQwJmV2EMhj3__qwf7CI26MnEbGHnejSU/pub?w=3539&h=2635)

## Sell your configurable app

Are you interested on selling your app? Then can do it if you you have:

* Created manually a configurable app or storymap
* Extended the functionality or improved the UX of an existing one
* Created a configurable app using web app builder

You just need to publish your app here: [arcgis.domake.io](https://arcgis.domake.io/)

## People you should know

Please find the ArcGIS Experts (story tellers and developers) on this topic here: [https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=Storymaps](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=Storymaps)

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
