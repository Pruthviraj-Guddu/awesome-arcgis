## Introduction

[ArcGIS Network Analyst](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-network-analyst/overview) is an Extension available for [ArcGIS Pro](../../arcgis-desktop/arcgis-pro/README.md), [ArcMap](../../arcgis-desktop/arcmap-arccatalog/README.md) and [ArcGIS Server](../../arcgis-enterprise/arcgis-server/README.md) to answer questions like:

* What is the quickest way to get from point A to point B?
* What houses are within five minutes of our fire stations?
* What market areas does our business cover?
* What is the nearest coffee shop from my current location?
* Which patrol cars can respond the quickest to these incidents?
* How can we route our fleet of delivery vehicles to minimize overall transportation costs and improve customer service?
* Where should we open a new branch of our business to maximize market share?
* Our company needs to downsize, and which stores should we close to maintain the most overall demand?
* What are live or historical traffic conditions like, and how do they affect my network analysis results?
* etc.
