# ArcGIS Pipeline Referencing

ArcGIS Pipeline Referencing provides the GIS-based capabilities you need to effectively and efficiently perform pipeline linear referencing data management. Because location is critical to almost every aspect of a pipeline operatorâ€™s business, the ability to know and communicate the exact location of any point or part of a pipeline and the events that happen on it is essential. Achieving this requires pipeline operators to manage and maintain a vast amount of information about their pipelines.
