## Introduction

[ArcGIS Full Motion Video](http://www.esri.com/products/arcgis-capabilities/imagery/full-motion-video) Add-in include capabilities for working with motion imagery inside
ArcMap thanks to MISB as you can see in this [short video](http://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=2805&isLegacy=true&title=introduction-to-the-full-motion-video-add_dash_in) (5min).

The new Multiplexer geoprocessing tool makes it easy for your
organization to create [MISB](http://www.gwg.nga.mil/misb/faq.html) compliant
videos yourself. Just provide previously recorded video and metadata from any
video source, and use the Multiplexer to easily combine them into a new video
file. The result is a MISB compliant video that is fully compatible with the
FMV Add-in and geoprocessing Tools.

You can add a file or an stream source if you plain to work with real time videos.
