#### Does GitBook supports RTL/bi-directional text ?

The GitBook format supports right to left, and bi-directional writing. To enable it, you either need to specify a language (ex: `ar`), or force GitBook to use RTL in your `book.json`:

``` json
{
    "language": "ar",
    "direction": "rtl"
}
```

With version 3.0 of GitBook, it's automatically detected according to the content.
_Note that, while the output book will indeed respect RTL, the Editor doesn't support RTL writing yet_.

#### Should I use an `.html` or `.md` extensions in my links?

You should always use paths and the `.md` extensions when linking to your files, GitBook will automatically replace these paths by the appropriate link when the pointing file is referenced in the Table of Contents.

#### Can I create a GitBook in a sub-directory of my repository?

Yes, GitBooks can be created in [sub-directories](structure.md#subdirectory). GitBook.com and the CLI also looks by default in a serie of [folders](structure.md).

#### Does GitBook supports RTL languages?

Yes, GitBook automatically detect the direction in your pages (`rtl` or `ltr`) and adjust the layout accordingly. The direction can also be specified globally in the [book.json](config.md).
