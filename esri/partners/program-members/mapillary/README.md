## Introduction

**Web**: [Mapillary Inc.](https://www.mapillary.com/) | **Based in**: Brooklyn | **Program**: [Partner program](../../programs/partner-program/README.md)

Mapillary is a new approach to street-level imagery. Our platform creates 3D reconstructions of locations from the street-level photos for extracting geospatial data using computer vision. Mapillary allows the capability for anyone to collect street level photos with smartphone apps and off-the-shelf equipment. With advanced features like time filtering and automated traffic sign detection, Mapillary is ideal for projects which require fast turnaround, frequent updates and fresh coverage.
