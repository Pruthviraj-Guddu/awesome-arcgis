5G promise greater speed and data capabilities to any aspect of our lives, but 5G won’t automatically eliminate today’s deficiencies. Wireless providers will still be challenged to decrease dropped calls, reduce data latency and expand network coverage to more customers.

All this falls on a better planning, fulfillment and assurance of 5G networks, and that can be achieved through combination of AI, big data, predictive capabilities and spatial analysis tools.
