## Introduction

[IoT](https://www.esri.com/en-us/iot/overview) use to be related with [Real-time](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/real-time) and Big data in the platform, but that's not always the case, that's why we have created a separated page for [ArcGIS and Big Data](../../business-trends/data-management/big-data/README.md)
