## Introduction

[IoT](https://www.esri.com/en-us/iot/overview) use to be related with [Real-time](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/real-time) and Big data in the platform, but that's not always the case, that's why we have created a separated page for [ArcGIS and Big Data](../../business-trends/data-management/big-data/README.md)

There are a set of products in the ArcGIS platform you might want to know if you are interested in this topic:

* [GeoEvent](../../../arcgis/products/extensions/geoevent-server/README.md)
* [Spatiotemporal Big Data Store](../../../arcgis/products/arcgis-enterprise/data-store/spatiotemporal-big-data-store/README.md)
