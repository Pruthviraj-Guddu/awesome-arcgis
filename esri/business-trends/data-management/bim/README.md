# BIM

Building information modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. | *Source:  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling)*.

## Introduction

A new collaboration between [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/bim/hub/autodesk-esri) and Esri will put GIS and BIM at the center of construction projects, driving smarter decisions, optimized designs, accelerated project approvals, reduced cost, creating smarter cities and resilient infrastructure. Building the bridge between GIS and BIM will change the way we plan, design, and build our future ([more info](http://www.esri.com/landing-pages/autodesk-esri-strategic-alliance)).

## Training

Read the [ArcGIS Tools for BIM](https://greenshoots.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=df637a80bd17412caf4a4e075019748e) storymap.

### Videos

We have created a [BIM Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLahIW2YFPQd7eF_jbaYJ4RivZG2IoHdd-) that we think it might be worth to you to save ([how to save a Youtube Playlist](../../../assets/SavePlaylist.gif)).

Check also this [BIM Youtube Playlist from Don Khuene](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHTg8zWG0OulP3SzoEQdiFa4eMe0k1l3S).

On [*video.esri.com*](https://www.esri.com/videos/search?q=bim) you will find many technical talks.

## Community

If you need help you should probably go to the [3D group on GeoNet](https://community.esri.com/community/gis/3d) and mention one of the experts on GeoNet.

You might also find some Q&As on [Stackexchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/search?q=bim).

### People you should know

Please find the [ArcGIS Experts on this topic using this tool](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=BIM):

[![ArcGIS Experts Tool Screenshot](https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-experts/blob/master/assets/imgs/arcgis-experts-tool.png?raw=true)](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=BIM)

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
