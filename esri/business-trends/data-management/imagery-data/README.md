# Introduction

Learn more about [ArcGIS Imagery & Remote Sensing](http://www.esri.com/arcgis/imagery-remote-sensing).

When working with [imagery in the platform]((http://www.esri.com/data/imagery) you can collect and view imagery content from Esri and Esri partners like:

* **High-Resolution Global Basemaps**: Background imagery can serve as a canvas, providing context and validation for your GIS data.
* **Multispectral, Temporal, Dynamic Image Services**: Dynamic image services suitable for visualization and analysis include Landsat, National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and elevation data.
* **Premium Imagery Content**: Access current imagery without needing to manage it, including premium imagery from Nearmap and Hexagon.

But if you collect your own imagery, you can also use ArcGIS to process, analyze, and maintain it along with your raster data.

## Training

* [The ArcGIS Imagery Book](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-imagery-book/)

### Videos

We have created a [Imagery Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLahIW2YFPQd5uO1xe6QmO2wsQHfWnRs-B) that we think it might be worth to you to save ([how to save a Youtube Playlist](../../../assets/SavePlaylist.gif)).
