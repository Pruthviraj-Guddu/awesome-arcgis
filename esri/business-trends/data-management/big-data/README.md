# Big data

Big data is data sets that are so voluminous and complex that traditional data-processing application software are inadequate to deal with them. Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source. | *Source:  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)*.

## Introduction

[Big data](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/big-data/overview) use to be related IoT in the platform, but that's not always the case, that's why we have created a separated page for [ArcGIS and IoT](../../../emerging-technologies/iot-rt/README.md)

Some times it is also related with the management of **vast amounts of images**.

There are a set of products in the ArcGIS platform you might want to know if you are interested in this topic:
