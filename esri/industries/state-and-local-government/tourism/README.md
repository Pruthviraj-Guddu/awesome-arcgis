## Introduction

These are some of the Tourism GIS Applications:

* **Tourist Map** – Plotting out landmarks in tourist maps.
* **Sunrise and Sunset** – Finding the perfect sunrise and sunset during at any given location. (SunCalc)
* **Subway Map** – Simplifying maps for the reader to better understand such as the lines of a subway map in high contrasting colors. (Cartographer Toolkit** – Gretchen Peterson)
* **Linear Referencing** – Using linear referencing along shorelines to track volumes of organic debris.
* **Off-Beaten Tracks** – Finding the off-beaten track for backpackers and marking its position with 3 words. (Off-Beaten Track Location** – What3Words)
* **Safe Travel** – Advising travelers where unsafe location are on a map.
* **Tourism Dollars** – Tracking the exports of purchased goods and services using desire lines.
* **Sustainable Tourism Planning** – Identifying conflicting interests from tourism and solving issues by examining suitable locations for proposed developments.
* **Hotel Search** – Searching geographically for five star hotels using a circle radius.
* **Horizon Blockage** – Calculating the horizon blocking line in all directions from a given observation point with gvSIG’s Horizon Blockage.
* **Travel Mode Detection** – Detecting travel mode (walk, car, bus, subway and commuter rail) from a multi-modal transportation network using GIS and GPS in New York City.
* **Finding Islands** – Using satellite to find uninhabited islands around the world** – Landsat found Landsat Island near the coast of Canada.
* **Time Zones** – Representing time zones around the world.
* **Eco-Tourism Site Selection** – Gauging environmental impacts for sustainable eco-tourism sites.

* **Highway Planning** – Constructing viewpoints with multiple layers like ecology, topography and cultural features for a three-dimensional visual highway.
* **Virtual Arctic** – Exploring the Arctic in Google Street View without getting out of your chair.
* **3D Synthetic Scene** – Overlaying synthetic scenes over real scene. (Manifold)
* **Life Travels** – Accompanying travellers in their life travels in map-form. (Where in the World is Andrew?)
* **Yellowstone** – Putting all the pieces together in a GIS database at Yellowstone National Park including its geologic past, geyser recharge and seismic activity.
* **Trip Planning** – Adventuring around for your next road trip with pit stops and offbeat using suggested sites.
* **Observer Points** – Calculating visibility through multiple observer points.
* **Historic Street View** – Time-travelling in the past to see just how much a location has changed over time with historic street view.
