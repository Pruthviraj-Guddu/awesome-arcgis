## Introduction

ArcGIS can be used to develop games but also to build game scenarios as you will find on this page.

* **Oculus Rift** – Building realistic 3D environments with Esri CityEngine because virtual reality is all about location and a sense of place. (Esri CityEngine and Oculus Rift)
* **Building Virtual Environments** – Designing future buildings, roads, cities, and parks with video game contributions. (GIS and Gaming** – Matt Artz)
* **Geoguessr** – Embarking on an educational journey that takes you all over the world (Geoguessr)

## Awesome projects and cool demos

Many of this demos are available at the [Esri's Prototype Lab Portal](https://maps.esri.com/portal/WebApps/index.html) and the [Esri UK Map Labs team](https://maplabs.github.io/).

### Educational games / Serious games

* [Name that landmark](https://github.com/maplabs/name-that-landmark): The aim of the game is to guess a location from aerial imagery by scratching off a panel obscuring it. The more that is scratched the less a player scores. A player also scores less points the longer they take to name the location.

* [MapQuiz](https://maps.esri.com/rc/quiz/index.html):The game that tests your geographic literacy ([article](https://community.esri.com/groups/applications-prototype-lab/blog/2014/11/17/map-quiz))

* [A Game of Geodesics](https://maps.esri.com/jg/GeodesicsGame/index.html): Find the location that is equidistant to three random cities

* [Pin-tail](http://bit.ly/2lbwiuv): Pin the tail on the map is inspired by the well known party game 'pin the tail on the donkey'

* Interactive Puzzles ([Europe ](http://thinkmaps.github.io/Puzzle/index_en.html), [U.S. States](http://thinkmaps.net/puzzleus/index.html), [Portugal ](http://62.28.34.124/PuzzlePortugal/index_en.html) & [Brazil ](https://github.com/ezequias/PuzzleBrazil)): Drag the countries from the right side to the right position on the map.

* [Smart Beetles](https://www.slideshare.net/francisuji/esri-spain-conference-are-you-a-smart-citizen-try-smart-beetles) ([video](https://youtu.be/Ld0FHEItTh0?t=2m2s) | [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20prHlu4cvc) | [iOS app](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsmartbeetles.com%2Fios&v=Ld0FHEItTh0&event=video_description&redir_token=w0N0hx7XwfAd-kW7uXuX0AmQYRN8MTUyOTc1MzA4MkAxNTI5NjY2Njgy) | [Android App](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsmartbeetles.com%2Fandroid&v=Ld0FHEItTh0&event=video_description&redir_token=w0N0hx7XwfAd-kW7uXuX0AmQYRN8MTUyOTc1MzA4MkAxNTI5NjY2Njgy)): Video game to promote smart cities. Objective is that people know in a playful way the services offered by smart cities.
