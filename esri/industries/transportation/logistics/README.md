## Introduction

Logistics in GIS is a segment of the transportation industry as: "Roads and Highways", "Public Transport and Rail", "Airports and Aviation" and "Ports and Maritime". And some resources you will find here references to the transportation industry in general.

Said that, ArcGIS can be in logistics for:

* Optimize route planification and scheduling
    * Manage delivery windows
* Calculate Estimate Time of Arrivals (ETAs)
* Optimize campus and indoor routing
* Real time fleet monitoring
* Visualize real time traffic and incidents
* Geofencing
* Asset and workforce tracking
* Navigation
* Executive and operational dashboards
* Location-based business development analysis
* Environmental management
* ...

You can find more at the [European Transportation GIS Summit](http://www.esri.com/events/euro-transportation-summit)

There are also two storymaps related to this segment built by the [Esri Transportation Team](http://trans.maps.arcgis.com):

* [Location Analytics for Supply Chain](http://trans.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=23351791377146f39cab17e2253f912b)
